ðŸ§¬ BioGridClassifier (C / MinGW)

ðŸ“Œ Overview

A C console application (MinGW / gcc) that reads a matrix of integers from Veri.txt and classifies each value as Plant, Bug, Fly, or Flea according to given thresholds. The file may contain variable rows and columns with values separated by a single space.

ðŸ”¢ Classification Rules
Range	Class
1â€“9	Plant
10â€“20	Bug
21â€“50	Fly
51â€“99	Flea

All numbers are integers in the range [1, 99].
